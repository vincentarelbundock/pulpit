# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The release workflow now actually publishes the Homebrew Cask. It rendered
  `Casks/pulpit.rb` into a clone of the tap and then tested for changes with
  `git diff` *before* staging, which does not see an untracked file, so every
  release through 0.0.3 reported "the cask is already at …" and pushed
  nothing. `brew install --cask vincentarelbundock/tap/pulpit` answered "No
  casks found". The step stages first, and afterwards reads the cask back out
  of the tap through the GitHub API and fails the release if the tagged
  version is not being served.

### Changed

- macOS install instructions no longer pass `--no-quarantine`, which Homebrew
  removed in 4.5. A cask install costs the same one-time trip through System
  Settings → Privacy & Security as the disk image does; no flag skips it.

## [0.0.2] — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- The application crate is named `pulpit`, not `pulpit-app`, so `cargo install
  pulpit` installs the `pulpit` binary. The crate directory moved to
  `crates/pulpit/` and its redundant `[[bin]]` block is gone — the package name
  already names the binary.

### Fixed

- Every crate now carries the `description` and `repository` metadata
  crates.io requires. Without them `cargo publish` refuses the upload, which
  the 0.0.1 publish would have hit as soon as its registry token was set.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-08-14

The first published release. A complete presenter: two-window presentation,
display reconciliation, presenter layouts and their designer, speaker notes,
PDF links, presenter annotations, session recovery, and media overlays for
animated images and interactive HTML.

### Added

- The macOS disk image carries one universal `Pulpit.app`: the binary and the
  bundled libpdfium both have an arm64 and an x86_64 slice, so Intel Macs are
  supported by the same download. `make app-universal` builds it and CI
  asserts both slices are present.

- Every package now says where media comes from. The Nix build pins libmpv
  and a Chromium-family browser, the Homebrew cask installs mpv alongside the
  app, and the `.deb`, `.rpm` and AUR packages recommend mpv beside the
  browser they already recommended. Nothing is bundled and nothing is
  required: pulpit `dlopen`s libmpv and spawns the browser as a child, so a
  deck with no media needs neither.

### Fixed

- Slide changes no longer flicker. The audience window holds its last frame
  instead of dipping through a coarse render, presenter panels change texture
  only for a meaningful improvement instead of blinking through the whole
  coarse-to-refined ladder, navigation no longer cancels renders it still
  needs, and stepping backward is prefetched as thoroughly as stepping
  forward.

### Changed

- Deck thumbnails are rendered in a single pass at one width — sharp enough
  for the slider's preview card, chosen per document so the whole deck fits
  the budget — and never change afterwards, replacing the two-level
  coarse-then-refine warming.

- Renamed the package, its crates, its environment variables and its URI
  scheme from `teleprompt` to `pulpit`.
- Reorganized the documentation: prose sources now live in `docs-src/` as
  Typst and are compiled to `docs/` with Calepin (`make website`). The root
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the `docs/*.md` files were folded into
  `docs-src/internals.typ`, `docs-src/install.typ` and `docs-src/usage.typ`.
- Rewrote the `Makefile` with self-documenting targets (`make help`) and added
  `website`, `serve`, `version`, `bump` and `release`.
- Collected every licence text in `LICENSES/`, with a `README.md` there saying
  which licence covers which part of the package. Replaces the root
  `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` and the licence files that sat inside the vendored
  directories.
- `AGENTS.md` is now a symlink to `CLAUDE.md`, so agent guidance cannot drift
  between the two.
- `logo.svg` is used across the package: the README, the website logo and
  favicon, and the application icon in `packaging/pulpit.svg`, which is now
  the same artwork on a badge instead of unrelated placeholder shapes.
