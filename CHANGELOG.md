## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The foundation of document mode: pulpit can open an ordinary PDF, mark it
  with **native PDF annotations** and write the result out through Save As.
  A completed ink gesture becomes an `/Ink` annotation in the open document —
  not a flattened mark and not an overlay kept beside the file — and survives
  saving and reopening with its identity, geometry and style intact, in any
  standards-compliant viewer. Text highlighting writes a true `/Highlight`
  whose `/QuadPoints` describe the marked text runs, free text writes
  `/FreeText`, notes write `/Text`, and checks and crosses write `/Stamp`.
  The source file is never written: it is refused outright as a save
  destination.

  Underneath: canonical page geometry that survives every page rotation and
  crop box, stable annotation identity through `/NM`, one revision and one
  undo entry per user action with undo *restoring* an annotation rather than
  recreating it, and whole-or-nothing transactions so an eraser sweep that
  fails part-way leaves nothing applied. The AcroForm hazard corpus — 55
  documents that are each wrong in one named way — moved into the new
  development-only `pulpit-testkit` crate and runs against the engine.

  Document mode is a *layout*, not a second application: the new **Reader**
  and **Reader + Fields** built-ins sit beside the presenter layouts in the
  same designer, over the same store, and a PDF opening into one never
  changes which presenter layout is selected.

  Document mode is reachable: press **r** to move between reading a document
  and presenting it. Mode is which layout is mounted, not which document is
  loaded — nothing is closed and no revision changes — and the two modes
  remember their layouts apart, so choosing a presenter variant never changes
  what a PDF opens into. The reader scrolls continuously, zooms freely, and
  asks the document worker only for the pages in front of you.

  Behind it, an open PDF is held by a document worker: one document, one
  execution context, one process, which is another role of this same binary
  rather than a second one to install. Pages are rendered by the process that
  holds the mutated document, so a frame drawn after a commit contains the
  commit. A worker that goes leaves presentation mode alone.

  This is `SPEC-document.md` up to and including its ink milestone.
  Deliberately not here yet: form filling, which the specification now routes
  through PDFium's own form-fill environment and which is gated behind a spike;
  the live stroke preview, so a mark appears when its frame does rather than
  while it is being drawn; and crash recovery for unsaved annotations.

### Changed

- Choosing which display the audience window uses is no longer claimed as a
  capability on any platform, and the compositor-specific adapter that
  implemented it on Niri has been removed. On a Wayland session the audience
  window goes fullscreen on whichever output it is already on and the user is
  told so, exactly as in any other tiling compositor. Under Niri it used to
  move itself, through that compositor's `niri msg` IPC — a second path
  through reconciliation that only one desktop exercised, in exchange for
  saving a single manual window move. Window placement on X11, Windows and
  macOS is unchanged.

## [0.0.4] — 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Browser overlays are no longer stretched and cropped on a high-density
  display. The viewport asked of the browser was bounded per axis, so a large
  overlay on a 2× display had only its long edge shrunk to the 4096-pixel
  limit and reached the browser with a different aspect ratio than the
  rectangle it is drawn into — the picture arrived distorted, with its edges
  outside the frame. The bound now applies to both axes at once, and a frame
  whose shape still does not match its viewport is fitted with bars rather
  than stretched to fill it.

- The release workflow now actually publishes the Homebrew Cask. It rendered
  `Casks/pulpit.rb` into a clone of the tap and then tested for changes with
  `git diff` *before* staging, which does not see an untracked file, so every
  release through 0.0.3 reported "the cask is already at …" and pushed
  nothing. `brew install --cask vincentarelbundock/tap/pulpit` answered "No
  casks found". The step stages first, and afterwards reads the cask back out
  of the tap through the GitHub API and fails the release if the tagged
  version is not being served.

### Changed

- macOS install instructions no longer pass `--no-quarantine`, which Homebrew
  removed in 4.5. A cask install costs the same one-time trip through System
  Settings → Privacy & Security as the disk image does; no flag skips it.

## [0.0.2] — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- The application crate is named `pulpit`, not `pulpit-app`, so `cargo install
  pulpit` installs the `pulpit` binary. The crate directory moved to
  `crates/pulpit/` and its redundant `[[bin]]` block is gone — the package name
  already names the binary.

### Fixed

- Every crate now carries the `description` and `repository` metadata
  crates.io requires. Without them `cargo publish` refuses the upload, which
  the 0.0.1 publish would have hit as soon as its registry token was set.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-08-14

The first published release. A complete presenter: two-window presentation,
display reconciliation, presenter layouts and their designer, speaker notes,
PDF links, presenter annotations, session recovery, and media overlays for
animated images and interactive HTML.

### Added

- The macOS disk image carries one universal `Pulpit.app`: the binary and the
  bundled libpdfium both have an arm64 and an x86_64 slice, so Intel Macs are
  supported by the same download. `make app-universal` builds it and CI
  asserts both slices are present.

- Every package now says where media comes from. The Nix build pins libmpv
  and a Chromium-family browser, the Homebrew cask installs mpv alongside the
  app, and the `.deb`, `.rpm` and AUR packages recommend mpv beside the
  browser they already recommended. Nothing is bundled and nothing is
  required: pulpit `dlopen`s libmpv and spawns the browser as a child, so a
  deck with no media needs neither.

### Fixed

- Slide changes no longer flicker. The audience window holds its last frame
  instead of dipping through a coarse render, presenter panels change texture
  only for a meaningful improvement instead of blinking through the whole
  coarse-to-refined ladder, navigation no longer cancels renders it still
  needs, and stepping backward is prefetched as thoroughly as stepping
  forward.

### Changed

- Deck thumbnails are rendered in a single pass at one width — sharp enough
  for the slider's preview card, chosen per document so the whole deck fits
  the budget — and never change afterwards, replacing the two-level
  coarse-then-refine warming.

- Renamed the package, its crates, its environment variables and its URI
  scheme from `teleprompt` to `pulpit`.
- Reorganized the documentation: prose sources now live in `docs-src/` as
  Typst and are compiled to `docs/` with Calepin (`make website`). The root
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the `docs/*.md` files were folded into
  `docs-src/internals.typ`, `docs-src/install.typ` and `docs-src/usage.typ`.
- Rewrote the `Makefile` with self-documenting targets (`make help`) and added
  `website`, `serve`, `version`, `bump` and `release`.
- Collected every licence text in `LICENSES/`, with a `README.md` there saying
  which licence covers which part of the package. Replaces the root
  `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` and the licence files that sat inside the vendored
  directories.
- `AGENTS.md` is now a symlink to `CLAUDE.md`, so agent guidance cannot drift
  between the two.
- `logo.svg` is used across the package: the README, the website logo and
  favicon, and the application icon in `packaging/pulpit.svg`, which is now
  the same artwork on a badge instead of unrelated placeholder shapes.
