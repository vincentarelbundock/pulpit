adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] — 2026-08-14

The first published release. A complete presenter: two-window presentation,
display reconciliation, presenter layouts and their designer, speaker notes,
PDF links, presenter annotations, session recovery, and media overlays for
animated images and interactive HTML.

### Added

- The macOS disk image carries one universal `Pulpit.app`: the binary and the
  bundled libpdfium both have an arm64 and an x86_64 slice, so Intel Macs are
  supported by the same download. `make app-universal` builds it and CI
  asserts both slices are present.

- Every package now says where media comes from. The Nix build pins libmpv
  and a Chromium-family browser, the Homebrew cask installs mpv alongside the
  app, and the `.deb`, `.rpm` and AUR packages recommend mpv beside the
  browser they already recommended. Nothing is bundled and nothing is
  required: pulpit `dlopen`s libmpv and spawns the browser as a child, so a
  deck with no media needs neither.

### Fixed

- Slide changes no longer flicker. The audience window holds its last frame
  instead of dipping through a coarse render, presenter panels change texture
  only for a meaningful improvement instead of blinking through the whole
  coarse-to-refined ladder, navigation no longer cancels renders it still
  needs, and stepping backward is prefetched as thoroughly as stepping
  forward.

### Changed

- Deck thumbnails are rendered in a single pass at one width — sharp enough
  for the slider's preview card, chosen per document so the whole deck fits
  the budget — and never change afterwards, replacing the two-level
  coarse-then-refine warming.

- Renamed the package, its crates, its environment variables and its URI
  scheme from `teleprompt` to `pulpit`.
- Reorganized the documentation: prose sources now live in `docs-src/` as
  Typst and are compiled to `docs/` with Calepin (`make website`). The root
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the `docs/*.md` files were folded into
  `docs-src/internals.typ`, `docs-src/install.typ` and `docs-src/usage.typ`.
- Rewrote the `Makefile` with self-documenting targets (`make help`) and added
  `website`, `serve`, `version`, `bump` and `release`.
- Collected every licence text in `LICENSES/`, with a `README.md` there saying
  which licence covers which part of the package. Replaces the root
  `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` and the licence files that sat inside the vendored
  directories.
- `AGENTS.md` is now a symlink to `CLAUDE.md`, so agent guidance cannot drift
  between the two.
- `logo.svg` is used across the package: the README, the website logo and
  favicon, and the application icon in `packaging/pulpit.svg`, which is now
  the same artwork on a badge instead of unrelated placeholder shapes.
